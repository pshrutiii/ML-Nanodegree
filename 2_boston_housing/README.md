## Project 2: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
GOAL: Apply basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home in the Boston, Massachusetts area.

### Software Requirements
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Data
The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 490 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features:
**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-student ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes

This project contains three files:

- `boston_housing.ipynb`: main file
- `housing.csv`: dataset
- `visuals.py`: supplementary file to help visualize (graph)

### Key take aways:
- NumPy = to investigate latent features of the dataset.
- Analyze learning performances (based on variance and bias) from plots.
- Determine best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
- Evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.

### What's Next?
Using the full dataset (from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing) try to .............
